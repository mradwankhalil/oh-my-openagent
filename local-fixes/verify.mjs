/**
 * Verify that the LOADED bundle actually contains every ledgered local fix.
 *
 *   bun run fixes:verify
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * `fixes:apply` verifies the bundle only AFTER it builds one. Nothing stopped a
 * build from a branch that does not carry the fixes — `git checkout <pr-branch>`
 * silently disarms everything, `dist/index.js` is rebuilt without the fixes, and
 * opencode.json loads it anyway. That is how a session can lose 12 fixes and
 * still look healthy.
 *
 * This is the cheap pre-flight: no build, no writes, ~1s. Run it before trusting
 * a bundle, and after any checkout, pull, or release.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = bundle is trustworthy, 1 = do not trust this bundle.
